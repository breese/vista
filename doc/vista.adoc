= Vista

Bj√∏rn Reese

== Introduction

Vista is a header-only C++11 library that contains various span classes.

The span classes acts like fixed-capacity in-place containers operating on contiguous memory provided by the user.

The span classes do not take ownership of the user-provided memory. User must ensure the life-time of the memory until the span has been destroyed.

== Span

Spans operate on borrowed continguous memory. Some <<rationale.adoc#,design decisions>> are common to all spans.

- <<map/span.adoc#,Map span>> is an associative array operating on borrowed storage.

== View

Views operate on borrowed continguous memory. Some <<rationale.adoc#,design decisions>> are common to all views.

- <<circular_view.adoc#,Circular view>> is a circular queue operating on borrowed storage.
- <<priority_view.adoc#,Priority view>> is a priority queue operating on borrowed storage.

== Fixed-Capacity Container

- <<circular_array.adoc#,Circular array>> is a circular queue operating on a nested array.

== Algorithm

- <<algorithm.adoc#,Algorithms>> operate on heap or sorted sequences.
