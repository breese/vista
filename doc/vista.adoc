= Vista

Bj√∏rn Reese

== Introduction

Vista is a header-only C++11 library that contains various span classes.

The span classes acts like fixed-capacity in-place containers operating on contiguous memory provided by the user.

The span classes do not take ownership of the user-provided memory. User must ensure the life-time of the memory until the span has been destroyed.


== Circular Queue

<<circular/span.adoc#,Circular Span>>:: The circular span is a view that makes user-owned contiguous storage appear like a circular queue.
<<circular/array.adoc#,Circular Array>>:: The fixed-sized circular array is a circular queue operating on an embedded `std::array<T, N>`. Unlike `std::array<T, N>` this class also keeps track of how many elements have been inserted.

== Sorted List

<<sorted/span.adoc#,Sorted Span>>:: The sorted span is a view that makes user-owned contiguous storage appear like a sorted list.
